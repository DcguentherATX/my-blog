    "description": "Launderette has a beautiful setting in a revamped laundromat with a cool blue bar, ample indoor seating and, a spacious outdoor patio. For starters, the Beet Hummus and Burrata are to delicious.  When it comes to entrees, the Agnolotti and Octopus cannot be beat.  Brunch is also a delight, however, I recommend arriving early to get the pastry of the day followed by the pastrami hash.  In terms of cocktails, I recommend the Wild Honey or the Better Bird."

The decor makes you feel like you’re in the heart of the Southwest and I recommend starting out with the Nada Paloma or a House Margarita.  I had the Chorizo Molotes, Suadero Tacos, and Carne Asada.  All packed a flavorful punch of Tex Mex flavors worthy of the restaurant’s stellar reputation."

    "description": "Justine’s is the perfect spot for an early spring date before the weather gets too hot.  The expansive outdoor dining space is attractively decorated and transports the diner to the south of France.  I highly recommend the Tuna Tartare as an hors d’oeuvres.  Following that, I split the Steak Frites and Moules Frites.  Both were flavored to perfection for a divine dining experience.  Of course, the wine list is full of robust French wines."

The communal design of the menu allowed us to try many delights, including the Guacamole, Atun, Borracho Snapper, Duck Carnitas, Barbacoa Beef Short-Rib, and Lamb al Carbon.  I’ve had a lot of Mexican food in my days, and this list was absolute perfection.  Paired with margaritas all around, it was an outstanding experience."

I recommend going on a Tuesday, as bottles of wine are half off.  The first time I went, I had the Steak Tartare, Wagyu Bavette, and 44 Farmsburger.  The burger was one of the best I’d ever had with flavors that were unparalleled in my burger experience.  Upon return, everything was oversalted, from the appetizers, to the entrees, and the sides.   I still recommend it, I think I went on an off night."

    "description": "Personally, I believe that Vixen’s Wedding is one of the best recent additions to the Austin culinary scene.  Located in the Arrive Hotel, Vixen’s is a mix of Portuguese and Goan cuisines, with flavors that blend beautifully.  The menu is meant to be shared, so I’ve tried many options.  I can say the Tortured Beet, Pork Buns, and Chaat Fried Green Tomatoes are exquisite.  My favorite pairing, however, is Tumeric Sourdough bread dipped in the Steamed Mussels broth.  There is even a selection of Indian Whiskey which is a delicious departure from the American style."

The Tuna Ceviche and Green Chile Smoked Fish Pimento are excellent small bites to start with.  I also recommend the Fried Oysters, Grilled Antelope, and the Goat Chili Pasta.  My only hesitation is on the Chorizo Nachos, which felt like a menu filler and didn’t add much to the experience.  Bourbon paired well with most of my dinner selections."

For ramen, I recommend the Tonkotsu Original or the Mi-So-Hot if you like things on the spicy side.  Adding any of the bombs will enhance the flavor and the ample extra toppings allow for a satisfyingly customizable bowl.  Make sure to bring your appetite, you won’t leave hungry."

When I visited, I opted for the Chef’s Tasting menu, which led me down a path of highs and lows.  The majority of the tasting was vegetarian based, and while most items were delicious, some missed the mark texturally.  What I remember enjoying off the menu were the Spicy Crab Crackers, the Seasonal Salad, and the Potato Gnocchi."

It is organized in the traditional cafeteria arrangement with sides coming first and meats on the side.  I definitely recommend the Brisket and the Sausage.  The Mac and Cheese, Spanish Rice, and Creamed Corn are all pleasing sides.  With original, sweet, and spicy bbq sauce options on the table, you can season to your liking.  In my opinion, they have perfected bbq sauce in comparison to their competitors."
